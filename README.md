# Dog_vs_Cat_detection

A Dog vs Cat Detection project is a classic binary image classification task in deep learning. The goal is to train a model that can distinguish between images of dogs and cats. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and steps involved:

1. Key Concepts Needed

(A) Deep Learning Basics

Neural Networks: Understand how layers (input, hidden, output) process data.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image processing.
Convolution Layers: Detect features (edges, textures).
Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions (max pooling, average pooling).
Fully Connected (Dense) Layers: Classify features.
Activation Functions: ReLU (for hidden layers), Sigmoid (for binary output).
(B) Image Preprocessing

Resizing: Standardize image dimensions (e.g., 224x224 for ResNet).
Normalization: Scale pixel values (0-255 â†’ 0-1).
Data Augmentation: Improve generalization using:
Rotation, flipping, zooming, brightness adjustments.
(C) Model Training & Evaluation

Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy (since it's a 2-class problem).
Optimizer: Adam, SGD, or RMSprop.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
Confusion Matrix.
(D) Transfer Learning (Optional but Recommended)

Use pre-trained models like:
VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, EfficientNet.
Fine-tune on the dog vs cat dataset.
